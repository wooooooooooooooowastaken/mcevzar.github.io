Scientists should write more texts that are aimed towards a general public. But it used to be complicated to copy and paste all the references etc. format the text and graphics, publish...
Below are the tools to perform all of the above in a fast and easy way.

We will take two biggest pains out of writing referenced text. 
Citations and design.


## 1. If you have nowhere to publish or want to publish on your own website, otherwise skip this part 

Setup your free webpage using GitHub Pages.
 
[LINK to Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)


## 2. Get access to papers in a legal way

[Read paywalled research papers for free. ](http://unpaywall.org/)

## 3. Copy & Paste on steroids

[Easy Copy](https://sites.google.com/site/smokyinkproductions/easy-copy) allows you to copy text and then paste it in MediaWiki, Markdown or any other form or syntax you wish. 
I use this `[%title%](%url%)` which will paste the words I colored together with the URL and put them in Mardown syntax.

## 4. Setup Mendeley to automaticaly generate .bib files

- [Install Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)

- [Set Mendeley watched folders](http://support.mendeley.com/customer/en/portal/articles/989571-how-to-use-the-watched-folders-feature) to automatically update your paper database when you add a new paper into a folder on your computer.

- [Set Mendeley to automaticaly generate .bib files](https://blog.mendeley.com/2012/03/24/how-to-series-generate-bibtex-files-for-your-collections-for-use-in-latex-part-3-of-12/)
`.bib` files are used for creating a citation database and can be used in a number of "languages" such as Latex and Markdown to name a few. We will use this files to enable autocomplete function for our citations

## 5. Setup a text editor for writing the text

- I recommend [**RMarkdown with RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/) as your text editor 
   
   - [how to use](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), 

   - [how to cite](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citation_styles).



**Appendix** 

You can install **SublimeText** or **Atom**, they offer autocomplete for your bib files but need to install some plugins and expect some tweaking. Maybe also Jupyter Notebook also has that feature.
