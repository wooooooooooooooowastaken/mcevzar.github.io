## Communication with people outside your field

- **For listening to someone with a different point of view, especially an "absurd" one** 

>“Thank you for sharing that. Tell me your story. I’d love to know how you came to this point of view.” 

        You can’t argue with crazy.

## How to explain scientific topics by Dominic Walliman
[Link to his TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARWBdfWpDyc)

1. Start at audience knowledge base
   * ask what they now

2. Don't go too deep

3. Clarity beats accuracy
   * they can iron out the details later if they are interested
   
4. Explain why you think it's cool
