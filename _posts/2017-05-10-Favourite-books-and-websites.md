### SCIENCE

Why to learn science? Below are great novels that will help you answer the question why science is cool :D

- [Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality - FREE](http://hpmor.com/) - the most popular fanfic featuring a genius scientist Harry Potter in an alternate magical universe

- [The Martian](https://www.readanybook.com/ebook/the-martian-565265)

- **Contact** by Carl Sagan. 
 I love the fact that the leading character is a woman. Not enough women in STEM.

- **Foundation trilogy** by Isaac Asimov (sadly not translated in Slovenian, if I will have the time I will do it)

- **Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!** autobiography from a great physicist and great physics teacher (not often are those two skills combined)

To try and "understand" todays world, I would start in the following order: **math, physics, basic computer science, cognitive neuroscience**.

### Math websites

- [Spletna učilnica FMF 2016/17](https://ucilnica.fmf.uni-lj.si/login/index.php) Spletna učilnica Fakultete za matematiko in fiziko, je prosto dostopna ;)

- [Learning math on your own](https://medium.com/@amathstudent/learning-math-on-your-own-39fe90c3536b)

- [Here’s How to Teach Yourself Physics and Math](https://futurism.com/want-physicist-heres-guide/)

- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) a great youtube channel that can provide with an visual intuition of math

- [Astra](http://astra.si/) tukaj so na voljo odlične razlage s področja "računanja" oz. komputacij vendar ni veliko materiala o tem zakaj računamo na tak način, kar je pomembno za razumevanje

 Malo koristi imaš od matematičnih formul, če jih znaš računati vendar ne veš kje bi ti lahko prišle prav. 

### Physics websites

- [How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html)

- [So You Want to Learn Physics...](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics)

### Physics Books

- **Thinking Physics** - a perfect beginner’s guide to an amazingly wide range of physics-related questions (one of my favourites)

- [The Feynman Lectures on Physics - FREE](http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) ranging from the basic principles of Newtonian physics through such formidable theories as general relativity and quantum mechanics, Feynman’s lectures are one of the best collections of books on physics

### Computer science websites

- [TOMO](https://www.projekt-tomo.si/accounts/login/?next=/course/17/) Slovenska stran za učenje programiranja 

- [CODEQ](https://codeq.si/?s=login) odlična stran za začetnike programiranja, ponuja Python, Prolog in Lego Mindstorm.

- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

### Cognitive neuroscience books

- **Introduction to Biopsychology** a nice introduction to neuroscience that doesn't require any previous knowledge 

- [Gödel, Escher, Bach - FREE](https://www.physixfan.com/wp-content/files/GEBen.pdf) - classic book about how cognition and thinking emerge from well-hidden neurological mechanisms

## RATIONALITY

**Rationality websites**

- [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) portal on rationality, cognitive practice

- [Clearer Thinking](http://www.clearerthinking.org/) free online tools, courses, and training programs aimed at avoiding thinking traps and making improved decisions 

- [Center for Applied Rationality](http://rationality.org/) nonprofit aimed at turning cognitive science to cognitive practice, they made an awesome [rational habit checklist](http://2ho3pq1fpuw423qecr4886n1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/checklist_of_rationality_habits.pdf)

- [Cognitive bias list](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) your brain uses shortcuts and sometimes those don't lead where we want to go, here is a more graphical representation
