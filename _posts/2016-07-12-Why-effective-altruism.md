My name is Michel Cevzar and I used to spend most of my younger days between enjoying myself and volunteering. Now I am trying to become an effective altruist.  

For me the journey to become an altruist came in the following stages.

## 1. stage: Enjoying myself and my youth

**I had a bucket list** that looked something like this:

 - travel as much as possible
 - meet as many amazing people
 - experience as many things as possible in order to find out your "calling"
 - try living on the sea side, preferably like a surfer
 - learn climbing
 - go on Erasmus
 - go skydiving and later into BASE wingsuit flying

 *There are some things that are better done when you are young, handsome, at the peak of your physical fitness and your tactile sensory imput is at it's peak. Yeah your granma doesn't see or feel touch as well as a teenager does. Plus you have less responsibility and enough free time ;)*
 
 
**I did all of them except for the last one**, I saved the skydiving, because I am waiting for the methodology and equipment to get better.
  
And for another reason... **I want to earn it.**

## 2. stage: Traveling 

**It entroduced me to material minimalism and put things in a global perspective.**

It's easier to travel if you can fit your stuff in one big backpack, not to mention cheaper. 

Couchsurfing and going to places where locals go, I got exposed to a bigger insight into lives of people from Marocco to Sweden. When I saw the poverty in some places I determined to support local business where ever I went. Plus it made me feel I bit quilty about enjoy myself while people were struggling to survive from day to day. 

*Changing enviroments also helped me a lot to reinvent myself as in a new enviroment habits lose their triggers and it's much easier to establish new habits.* **We are what we repeatedly do.**

*All my stuff still fits into 2 backpacks and if I buy or get something new, I get "rid" of something else in my possesion.*

## 3. stage: What's the point of hedonism?
 
When I was surfing for 3 months in Portugal, it came like a moment of relief as I have finished the most important points on my bucketlist.  

Besides I realised that hedonism as such doesn't do anybody much good. 

>I was just a junkie for the "pleasure" neurotransmiters in my brain. 

Most of the fun was just that fun and nothing more.  

___Fun and hedonism exist only inside your head.___

## 4. stage: What is the point of an average middle class life?

Work, home, wife, kids, sleep, repeat. Maybe a morgage so you can afford your own house and die in peace on your piece of land. 
***Congratulations you passed on your "very important" genes and well that is your legacy.***

Your life will have very little meaning and small longterm impact on the world at large. The effect you will have will stay in your own little bubble/village/town. Essentialy your life is irrelavant.

## 5. stage: How to become an effective altruist?
This is where I am now. 

Why just altruism isn't **good enough**?  

Well,

>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Ignorance is one of the biggest enemies of effective altruists.

There have been and are many NGO, that don't understand the problem they are trying to solve well enough and are not putting their resources to maximum effect or are even making things worse. 

_Like the tomato planting NGO in Africa._ Remind me to tell you about that.

>Are you an effective altruist?

- Will anything change in the world if the organisation/ company I work for stop existing this very moment?

If the answer is nothing, well then I would have a problem with that. 

You spend most of your life at work.  

Do something that meanigfully benefits the largest number of people possible and does't waste our natural resources.

If you know that a couple of hours of volunteering is maximum what you can do AND you do that - I aplaud you. That is already much more than most people. If you add to that lowering your consumption, "FIST BUMP" fellow citizen of the world. 

## Appendix: Question for the fellow consumer

Dear consumer,

how does it feel one week into buying that BMW and new Armani Jeans?

Does it empower you? Make you feel amazing? Will it enable you to make even more money, get more leverage, influence and power?

**Power, influence, leverage to do what?**

You have an amazing amount of power at your fingertips and you "wasted" it on taking care of your ego. Your ego that exist only in that place between your ears.

And that in 100 years after your death you will have no relevant effect on this planet and society. It doesn't matter if you even lived. 

Big deal if you partied your life away, no one will care. If all you did was make money and spawn some kids, no one will care.

But the whole world remembers a monk,a nune, a doctor  and many others that had nowhere near the amount of money and yet did what they could and that was much more than you.
