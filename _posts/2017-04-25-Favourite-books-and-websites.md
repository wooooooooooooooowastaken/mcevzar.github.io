[**HERE**](https://www.bibsonomy.org/user/michelc) you can browse and search all my web browser bookmarks. 
I use tags to mark my bookmarks, so if you want to see more of what is great stuff on the topic of mathematics, just type "mathematics"
and you will get all the link in chronological order with latest at the top.

### SCIENCE

Why to learn science? Below are great novels that will help you answer the question why science is cool :D

- [Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality - FREE](http://hpmor.com/) - the most popular fanfic featuring a genius scientist Harry Potter in an alternate magical universe

- [The Martian](https://www.readanybook.com/ebook/the-martian-565265)

- Contact by Carl Sagan. 
 I love the fact that the leading character is a woman. Not enough women in STEM.

- Foundation collection by Isaac Asimov (sadly not translated in Slovenian, if I will have the time I will do it in next 10 years)

To understand todays world, I would start in the following order: **math, physics, basic computer science, cognitive neuroscience**.

#### Math

**Math websites**


- Spletna učilnica Fakultete za matematiko in fiziko, je prosto dostopna ;)

- [Learning math on your own](https://medium.com/@amathstudent/learning-math-on-your-own-39fe90c3536b)

- [Here’s How to Teach Yourself Physics and Math](https://futurism.com/want-physicist-heres-guide/)

#### Physics

**Phyiscs websites**

**Physics Books**

- **Thinking Physics** - a perfect beginner’s guide to an amazingly wide range of physics-related questions (one of my favourites)

- [The Feynman Lectures on Physics - FREE]() ranging from the basic principles of Newtonian physics through such formidable theories as general relativity and quantum mechanics, Feynman’s lectures are one of the best collections of books on physics

- **Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!** autobiography from a great physicist and great physics teacher (not often are those two skills combined)


#### Computer science

#### Cognitive neuroscience

- **Biopsychology** you know the parts of your computer and how they work, but do you know about your own hardware aka your brain

## RATIONALITY

- [Cognitive bias list](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) your brain uses shortcuts and sometimes those don't lead where we want to go, here is a more graphical representation
- [Cognitive Biases Poster](http://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1-71TzKnr7bzXU_l_pU6DCNA.jpeg) -  well designed poster with a number of cognitive biases
