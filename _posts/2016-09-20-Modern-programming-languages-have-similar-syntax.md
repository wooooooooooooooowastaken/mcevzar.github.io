# Python, Swift, Julia, Go 
**All have quite similar syntax and one can see how programming languages of the future will look like. In my opinion it is 
becoming more and more easy to translate a formal spoken English language into code (pseudocode). There is a good chance if you already know how to programm in one off the languages below that you could write some code with minor changes to your syntax.**

Let's have a look at the most classical and usually the first programm someone would run in a new programming language
**"Hello Word"**

### Python
```
print("Hello World")
```


### Swift
&nbsp;
```
print("Hello World")
```


### Julia
&nbsp;
```
print("Hello World")
```

### Go*
*Go a C-style flavour, in the beggining we import the "fmt" (formating) package that we need for "printing" out our code
and Go, like C supports main function. The function that actually does what we want `fmt.Print("Hello World")` looks very similar to the ones above.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    fmt.Print("Hello World")

}
```
