# Python, Swift, Julia, Go 
**All have quite similar syntax and one can see how programming languages of the future will look like. In my opinion it is 
becoming more and more easy to translate a formal spoken English language into code (pseudocode). There is a good chance if you
already know how to programm in one off the languages below that you could write some code with minor changes to your syntax.**

Let's have a look at the most classical and usually the first programm someone would run in a new programming language
**Hello Wordl**

###Python
```
print("Hello World")
```

###Swift
```
println("Hello World!")
```

###Julia
```
println("Hello World")
```

###Go
*Go a C-style flavour, in the beggining we import the "fmt" (formating) package that we need for "printing" out our code
and Go, like C supports main function. If we take that into consideration the main bit looks like `fmt.Println("Hello World")`,
which is again very similar to other programming languages mentioned.
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    fmt.Println("Hello World")

}
```
