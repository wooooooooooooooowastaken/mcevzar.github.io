The biggest part of analysis paralysis in terms if effective altruism for me was the following statement: 

**"All lives have equal value".**

Do people believe that, is there any research on the topic or is it just a mindset that helps out of analysis paralysis?

The people that we save by buying mosquito nets. 
Are they really going to contribute back to the human race? Or will they feel encouraged to have even more children they cannot support and continue living in ignorance?

I am being a devils advocate here, but isn't it better to save lives or improve standards in more developed countries where we know there is a more realistic chance of a better education?

Education is important I believe as ignorant people are already in the majority and we have enough of those. I invest more in NGO's in countries  located in Asia and India as they have better access to education and the culture focuses more on work ethic. In Africa there isn't even basic infrastructure and an insane amount of corruption.

I don't know and if you can educate me please do especially if you know of some research on the topic.

Best, Michel
