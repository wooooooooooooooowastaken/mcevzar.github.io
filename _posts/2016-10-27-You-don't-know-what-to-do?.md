If you don't know which direction in life to take or what to do just yet, here is a suggestion.
&nbspc;

- Save some money for when you will "know" how to put it to good use.
- Keep honing your skills and gather knowledge even if it means *"reinventing"* stuff.
&nbsc;

There are skills you are going to need in the future no matter what you are planning to do.
**Programming, understanding of physics and math, critical thinking, design, social skills** won't be out of fashion for a while :)
